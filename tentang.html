    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>Hai! i'm Ilmi, a beginner coding but full of enthusiasm ðŸš€</p>
       <p>I made this page for myself. As a beginner I still rely on chat GPT heheh. But I learned every code so that I could understand each of these learning processes. I hope that after creating this page, I can be more free to understand developments in the field of technology in the present and in the future. <p> 
<p>Starting from seeing xaviera's post, a woman who is intelligent, full of curiosity, and has a high spirit in pursuing her dreams. She is known as a very friendly and sociable woman and always gives a good thing that she does during the study process in South Korea. From there, I started learning coding to increase my knowledge in the field of technology so that I would not be left behind with technological sophistication in the future..
<p>
<p>In addition, I saw a post about investing from a young man named Timothy Ronald, thanks to his post I can now start to set aside some of my money to save. So, just take the positives yes guys hehehehh<p>
